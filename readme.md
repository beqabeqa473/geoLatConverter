# GeoLatConverter #

This addon makes possible to transliterate georgian text to english and backwards.
It was created because there are lots of literature in georgian language written using latin fonts so it is hard to read this type of texts.

There are two scripts for convert georgian characters to its english equivalent and one for converting english chars to georgian.
